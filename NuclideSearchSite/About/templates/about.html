	<h2>About NuclideSearch</h2>
</div>

Being a long time user of the <a href="http://nucleardata.nuclear.lu.se/toi/">Lund/LBNL Nuclear Data Search</a> site, I found that the design and usability did not meet up to the standards of modern websites. When I found the database behind the site freely available (<a href="http://ie.lbl.gov/databases/databases.html">here</a>), I decided that it would be possible to replicate and improve the functionality of the Lund/LBNL-site with relative ease. Most if not all the functionality of the Lund/LNBL-site was re-implemented though the layout was changed significantly. In addition, the search system of this site is a vast improvement over the Lund/LBNL-site. Some smaller improvement are also provided such as nuclide history and better navigation between mother and daughter nuclides. If you have additional suggestions on improving the site, please <script type='text/javascript'><!--

<h3>Technical details</h3>
The site uses the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com">Django-framework</a> for all the backend functionality. The nuclear data is stored in a <a href="http://www.sqlite.org">SQLite</a> database. For styling, the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> front-end framework is used. To provide tables that can be sorted without reloading the page <a href="https://github.com/drvic10k/bootstrap-sortable">bootstrap-sortable</a> is used. Auto completion is provided by the <a href="http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/">typeahed.js</a> library.

The site does not keep track of your searches. This data is instead stored by your browser using the local storage functionality introduced in HTML 5.

			The handbook <B><I>Table of Isotopes</I></B>&nbsp; has for many years been the most
			widely used source of information for nuclear structure and decay data.
			Please refer to <B><A HREF="http://ie.lbl.gov/toi.html">this link</A></B> 
			for information about the book, the CD-ROM and also additional tables and
			information on nuclear data.
			This service is intended to give convenient Web access to the 
			<B><I>Table of Isotopes</I></B>&nbsp; data. <P>


			At present only part of the decay data is implemented, but the service
			will eventually include search facilities, table generators, charts and

			<LI>Stable nuclides are given a half life of 1e+35 s. If you want to exclude

			Unless explicitly specified, data are from the Evaluated Nuclear Structure File (ENSDF).
			ENSDF is updated and maintained by the National Nuclear Data Center (NNDC) at BNL. 
			References to ENSDF evaluations (published in Nuclear Data Sheets) are
			given in the main table of the respective nuclide. This ENSDF citation
